RTCPP
============

  The idea of this project is to implement realtime data structures and algorithms
  in C++. Most of what is implemented here was taken from the book "The Art of Computer
  programming Vol. 1 and 3".

Node based
=============

  Node based containers were my main motivation to begin this project. The bad
  thing about standard containers in C++ is the way they handle memory. There are
  some things that make me regret using them:

  1) If you are using the default allocator you are probabilly using malloc for
     each new item inserted in your container, malloc in turn makes use of
     system calls to make room for the new inserted item. Imagine yourself
     using new to allocate space for an int as would be the case for
     std::set<int> for example.  To avoid this one has to stick to custom
     allocators, however this does no solve all the problems.

  2) Dynamic allocations on the heap on systems that demand 7 - 24 availability
     are dangerous as you can end up with a very fragmented heap affecting 
     program performace.

  3) Even though one can use memory pools with allocators, they are more suitable
     for situations where the container size must increase on demand and one
     cannot place an upper bound on the maximum container size. In my job I
     often know in advance how big the container can increase. That means I
     am paying for what I do not need.

  These are some problems allocators cannot handle properly.

  a) It is difficult or maybe impossible to write an allocator with constant
     allocation time. With "contant" I mean something that does no depend on
     the container size or on how fragmented the heap may be. I do not mean
     "amortized" constant time. This fact is due mainly to the fact the
     container must abtain their value_type from allocators. If on the other
     hand they could get the node_type, contant time could be easily achieved
     as is this case, the the node_type links can be used to link the nodes
     toguether forming an avail stack. That way nodes can be allocated by 

                    node_pointer q = avail;
                    if (avail)
                      avail = avail->llink;
                    return q;

     We see that just a couple of instructions are used, which makes allocation
     realtime.

Compilation
=============

  To compile you will need a C++11 compiler and CMake. Boost libraries are optional.

  cmake  ~/rtcpp-dir -DBOOST_ROOT=path -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER="clang++" -DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS="-std=c++0x -Wall -Wextra -Werror"
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="~/local"
